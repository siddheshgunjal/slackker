# Introducing slackker! :fire:

`slackker` is a python package for monitoring your ML training status in real-time on slack channel. It can send you update for your ML model training progress and send final report with graphs when the training finishes. So now you don't have to sit in front of the machine all the time. You can quickly go and grab coffee :coffee: downstairs or run some errands and still keep tracking the progress while on the move.

## Requirements :clipboard:

* `slackker` utilises [slack_sdk][slack-sdk]`>=3.19.0` for communicating with slack API.
* To use the `slackker.callbacks` method in keras.callbackss [keras][keras]`>=2.0.0` is required.


## Installation :arrow_down:
* Install slackker from [PyPi][py-pi] is recommended. slackker is compatible with `Python >= 3.6` and runs on Linux, MacOS X and Windows. 
* Installing slackker in your environment is easy. Just use below pip command:

```bash
pip install slackker
```

## Getting started with slackker callbacks
### Setup Slack to work with slackker
* First create an [slack app][slack-app] from scratch in your workspace.
* we must give below mentioned permissions for `slackker` to be able to send status update and report to your channel:
  * `chat:write`
  * `chat:write.public`
  * `files:read`
  * `files:write`
* Now install the app to your workspace and copy our apps **Bot & OAuth Token**. it should be in following format:
```
 xoxb-123234234235-123234234235-123234234235-adedce74748c3844747aed48499bb
 ```
 * Now go to slack and add this slack app to the channel where you wish to receive al the update. Now we are ready to use `slackker` in your training flow!:smiling_imp:

### Using slackker callbacks with keras callbacks method
Import `slackker.callbacks` with following line:
```python
from slackker.callbacks import SLKerasUpdate
```
### Create slackker object
create slackker object with `SLKerasUpdate`
```python
slack_update = SLKerasUpdate(token="xoxb-123234234235-123234234235-123234234235-adedce74748c3844747aed48499bb",
    channel="A04AAB77ABC",
    modelName='SampleModel',
    export='png',
    sendPlot=True,
    verbose=0)
```
`SLKerasUpdate` takes following arguments:
* `token`: *(string)* Slack app token
* `channel`: *(string)* Slack channel where you want to receive updates *(make sure you have added slack app to this same channel)*
* `modelName`: *(string)* Name for your model. This same name will be used in future for title of the generated plots.
* `export`: *(string)* default `"png"`: Format for plots to be exported. *(supported formats: eps, jpeg, jpg, pdf, pgf, png, ps, raw, rgba, svg, svgz, tif, tiff)*
* `sendPlots`: *(Bool)* default `True`: If set to `True` it will export history of model, both training and validation, save it in the format given in `export` argument and send graphs to slack channel when training ends. If set to `False` it will not send exported graphs to slack channel. 
* `verbose`: *(int)* default `0`: You can sent the verbose level up to 3.
  * `verbose = 0` No logging
  * `verbose = 1` Basic/minimal logging
  * `verbose = 2` Info logging
  * `verbose = 3` Debug/In-depth logging

### Call slackker object into callbacks during model fit

Now you can call slackker object into callbacks argument just like any other callbacks object.
```python
history = model.fit(x_train, 
                    y_train,
                    epochs = 3,
                    batch_size = 16,
                    verbose=1,
                    validation_data=(x_val,y_val),
                    callbacks=[slack_update])
```

### Final code
```python
# Import library for keras
from slackker.callbacks import SLKerasUpdate

# Train-Test split for your keras model
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, train_size=0.8)
x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_train, y_train, train_size=0.8)

# Build keras model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(8,activation='relu',input_shape = (IMG_WIDTH, IMG_HEIGHT, DEPTH)))
model.add(Dense(3,activation='softmax'))
model.compile(optimizer = 'rmsprop', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Create Slackker object
slack_update = SLKerasUpdate(token="xoxb-123234234235-123234234235-123234234235-adedce74748c3844747aed48499bb",
    channel="A04AAB77ABC",
    modelName='SampleModel',
    export='png',
    sendPlot=True)

# Call Slackker object in model.fit() callbacks
history = model.fit(x_train, 
                    y_train,
                    epochs = 3,
                    batch_size = 16,
                    verbose=1,
                    validation_data=(x_val,y_val),
                    callbacks=[slack_update])
```
